# DotApp

This is the main class to create your app mand mange all your components.

```js
constructor () : DotApp
```
The constructor reiceve no params, but before doing anything else with the app is reccomanded to call another function: `use(store : DotStore, router : DotRouter)`, this function reiceves two parameters. One is the store (an instance of the `DotStore`) class witch is a utility class created to handle your application global state, you can also create your own state system. The other is a router (an instance of the `DotRouter`) used to manage your applications first level components (also called from now on routes or views) these views are simply `DotComponent` instaces but with some additional class apis and properties. If no store is provided an empty one will be created for you and will be accessible from the `app.$store` property, if no router is provided one will be created for you and inside the router a basic empty *index* view will be initiated and the router will be accessible within the `app.$router` property.
### Example
```js
const router = new DotRouter();
const app = new DotApp();
app.use(false, router);

app.$router; // This will be the same reference as your router from the first line
app.$store; // This will be an empty store
```
